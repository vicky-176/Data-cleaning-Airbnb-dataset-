Airbnb Data Cleaning Project

This project involves preparing raw Airbnb listing data for further analysis and visualization. The dataset contains detailed information on listings such as locations, host details, room types, pricing, and availability. Through a structured cleaning and preprocessing workflow, the data is transformed into a more reliable and analysis-ready format.

Project Structure

Airbnb_Open_Data.csv – Raw dataset obtained from Airbnb.

Data cleaning 1.csv – Processed dataset after applying cleaning steps.

Data Cleaning on airbnb dataset.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook documenting the entire cleaning workflow with explanations.

Objectives

The primary objective is to enhance the quality of the dataset so that it can be effectively used for analytics or modeling. The cleaning process includes:

Detecting and addressing missing values

Eliminating duplicate records

Standardizing formats for dates, prices, and other fields

Removing invalid or inconsistent entries

Improving column naming and structure for better readability

Optimizing data types for efficiency

Tools and Libraries

The project is developed in Python and makes use of widely adopted data science libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

How to Use

The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to the data cleaning process. Users can follow along to replicate the workflow, understand each transformation, and make modifications as needed. The final cleaned dataset (Data cleaning 1.csv) is available for use in further analysis, visualization, or machine learning applications.

Potential Applications

Once cleaned, the dataset can support a wide range of use cases, including:

Developing models for price prediction

Analyzing booking patterns and seasonal trends

Evaluating host performance

Exploring neighborhood popularity and availability
